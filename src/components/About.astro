                <p>For me it's about creating fast and simple websites. Astro.build is a 
    static site generator which can fetch data, integrate components from 
    React and utilize Tailwind with ease. This stack makes it easy to 
    produce everything from a portfolio to a blog.</p>

                    <h3  class="text-2xl">Hosting the website</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Netlify is an excellent chose for hosting websites. 
    The Netlify platform is granted access to the gitHub repository. Each 
    pusch to the respository will trigger a redeployment on Netlify. If 
    something is amiss or causes an error, Netlify will revert back to the 
    previous working version.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The stack can use Markdown files. These files are 
    located in a folder within the project. This is a good choice for a site 
    that doesn't need to generate new content. Another option is to use an 
    external API. With this option we can use any content management system 
    with an API, such as WordPress. It's a ideal choice for a blog.</p>
